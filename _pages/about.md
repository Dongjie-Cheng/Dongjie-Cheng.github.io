Introduction
======
* I’m **Dongjie Cheng(程东杰)**, a Junior student at Sichuan University. As the top-ranked student in my grade majoring in Artificial Intelligence, I was honored with the 2023 China National Scholarship for my academic excellence. 
* My research interests lie in emerging areas such as multimodal content generation and LLM (Large Language Models)-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
* Currently, I serve as a research assistant in **Dr. Kang Li**'s Lab at the **West China Hospital – Big Data Center**, where my contributions span several projects, including the evaluation and improvement of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and exploring evaluation methods for T2i (text-to-image) generation. 
* I am dedicated to conducting and publishing high-quality research as a pivotal step towards strengthening my application for a PhD program in the fall of 2025.

Current
======
* I am looking for remote internships, summer internships in 2024, and PhD opportunities in 2025.

Projects
------
**SAM project**

In the SAM project, We proposed using large models to generate descriptions for segmentation targets, feeding theses descriptions to the detection model to produce bounding boxes for SAM, thereby achieving zero-shot segmentation. 
I was responsible for conceiving and implementing specific experiments. Firstly, I completed the evaluation of the SAM model on multiple modalities medical datasets. Then I verified the effectiveness of the improvement method driven by LLM (Large Language Models). 
The results show that the improved method performs well under zero-shot conditions, outperforming the Grounded-SAM baseline on most datasets. The project ultimately resulted in two papers, of which I am a co-first author.

**T2i-Eval project**

In the T2i-Eval project, we proposed a method combining Scene Graph and Graph QA to score the quality of generated images, conducting a comprehensive evaluation of images from perspectives such as object omission, attribute inaccuracies, relational errors, and hallucinations.
I was responsible for generating evaluation dataset images, the specific design and experimentation of the Scene Graph part, achieving the construction of Scene Graphs through the use of GroundingDINO+BLIP VQA.
We constructed a human-evaluated dataset containing 12,000 images from 1,000 prompts and validated the effectiveness of our method. Compared with human evaluations, our Pearson and Kendall correlation coefficients surpassed those of T2ICompbench(Neurips 2023). This project ultimately resulted in one paper, for which I am a co-first author.
